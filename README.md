# Console Menuizer

ConsoleMenuizer is a C# project that makes it easy to create interactive menus for console applications in C#. It allows you to define the options and commands of the menus in a simple and fast way. It consists of two main components: the **Logic** and the **Screens**.

The **Logic** component contains the classes `Menu` and `MenuUI`, which represent and manage the menus.
- The `Menu` class is responsible for storing the options and commands of each menu, as well as the logic to execute them.
- The `MenuUI` class is responsible for rendering the menu on the console screen, as well as handling the user input and events.

The **Screens** component contains the class `Screens`, which provides methods to manipulate the console screen.

I think this project is very interesting and useful for anyone who wants to develop console applications in C# with more dynamic and attractive menus. It can help other developers save time and effort when creating and setting up the menus for their applications.
