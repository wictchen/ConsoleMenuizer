# Console Menuizer

> Console Menuizer is a C# project that helps create interactive menus for console applications.

The project has two simple components: the **Logic** and the **Screens**.

- The **Logic** contains two static classes:
  
  - The `Menu` class is responsible for storing the options and commands of each menu, as well as the logic to execute them.
  - The `MenuUI` class is responsible for rendering the menu on the console screen, as well as handling the user input and events.

- The **Screens** contain the class `Screen`, which provides template methods to manipulate the console screen.

Console Menuizer project allows you to define the options and commands of the menus in a simple and fast way.
